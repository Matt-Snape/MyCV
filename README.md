### Description
MyCV is a webpage that displays my curriculum vitae. The page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of my course I'm currently doing with HyperionDev, it is showcasing the skills I've learned so far and contains information about myself which is in an informl format. I also used bootstrap in order to make the site formatting correct for different screen resolutions and mobile devices.
